# Supply-Chain-Management-Optimization-Real-Example
An optimization project with Mathematical/Linear Programming to increase the supply chain process.

To solve the model GAMS/Cplex was used as a GAMS solver for the Mixed Integer Linear Programming problem. The dataset was directly imported to GAMS from excel data as it is separated by sheets.

The dataset was taken from:https://brunel.figshare.com/articles/dataset/Supply_Chain_Logistics_Problem_Dataset/7558679
